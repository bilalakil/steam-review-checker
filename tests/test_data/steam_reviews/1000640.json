It aims to be a funny game with an outlandish plot and wacky conversations. Generally I think it is well done. The art and music are obviously low budget and it's fine for an indie game.\n\nFor the cons, my biggest gripe is the horrendous UI and stability. The game was crashing every 20-30 minutes and keeping my CPU maxed at 100% the entire time. Kind of inexcusable given the very simple game. Even though your character only moves left and right, you still need to click and can't use the arrows. The speech is super lazy appearing above the head of the characters - the game uses a lot of very short sentences (for example, just ellipsis like \"...\") and sometimes you are just waiting to see what happens when the game is actually waiting on you to see two tiny dots. In an attempt to be witty there are way too many options in the conversations where you need to scroll down repeatedly. Lastly, the game is very short at 1.5-2 hours and as joked in one of the endings, is more a visual novel than an adventure game given how there is only 1 path to do things.\n\nIf the game was stable it would be a borderline positive recommendation but as it stands, too frustrating to play - good thing it was short so I didn't need to suffer too long! 3/10\n\nLastly for achievement hunters, it just takes one playthrough to get everything but you need to follow the Steam Guide as some of the trophies are missable and you cannot use chapter select so you would need to replay the game. Sometimes following a guide 'ruins' an adventure game, but in this case there was not much to explore anyway so no problems there.","timestamp_created":1614662498,"timestamp_updated":1614662498,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":false,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87448238","author":{"steamid":"76561198341775018","num_games_owned":90,"num_reviews":14,"playtime_forever":179,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":84,"last_played":1619736560},"language":"english","review":"How he have name of clam if he clam?????/?????????///?????????y???????/","timestamp_created":1614301670,"timestamp_updated":1614301670,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"87389380","author":{"steamid":"76561198950626854","num_games_owned":14,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":263,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":263,"last_played":1602175553},"language":"english","review":"great game","timestamp_created":1614221610,"timestamp_updated":1614221610,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"85229617","author":{"steamid":"76561198205895069","num_games_owned":535,"num_reviews":184,"playtime_forever":128,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":128,"last_played":1611439159},"language":"latam","review":"Clam Man es un juego corto (2hs) y gracioso.

After those four hours, you may find yourself driving to the local Red Lobster for more high-octane mollusk action. The charming hand-drawn aesthetic of the game's underwater setting, Snacky Bay, and its fishy inhabitants never loses its appeal. The writing will keep you grinning and chuckling during the entire play-through, and it feels wholly well paced. The story is easy to follow, but it will keep you glued to the screen to see what happens next in Clam Man's epic journey. Every character has a distinct personality, and one may want to explore every dialogue option just to get a sliver of that witty script. There are some jokes disguised as references (particularly during the final scenes) that may not land if you are unaware of them, but they will not take away from the total enjoyment that \"Clam Man\" offers.\n\nThe small team behind this game believed in their product, and that is evident throughout the game. The many small details and interactions that you will discover from exploring the nooks and crannies of Snacky Bay will turn that frown upside-down. This game is a breath of fresh air, and I highly recommend that you inhale deeply.\n\n9.69 / 10","timestamp_created":1591421469,"timestamp_updated":1591421469,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.581048130989074707","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70124154","author":{"steamid":"76561198094135606","num_games_owned":153,"num_reviews":3,"playtime_forever":180,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":180,"last_played":1590973861},"language":"english","review":"3 hours of non-stop laughing and excellent story writing with a main character who is a literal clam.

You play as Clam Man, a naïve bivalve who gets the rug pulled out from under him and is forced into an investigation that goes all the way to the top! It’s hard to be anymore specific without spoiling the game, but as the store page says it’s a pretty absurd narrative. Lots of fun though.\n\n[h1]Positives: [/h1]\n[*]The art style is a pretty casual cartoon-y style, I really like it and I think it fits the game well. It reminded me of the first Nelly Cootalot game, which is the game that got me into point & clicks. \n\n[*]Clam Man’s main draw is the humor, and they sure did deliver. I don’t think I’ve laughed out loud at a game more than I have with Clam Man. The jokes are consistently good over the course of the game, and I don’t think you need a specific sense of humor to enjoy them. There’s also a lot of really well done meta jokes that I thoroughly enjoyed. \n\n[*]The plot itself is fairly compelling. Despite being pretty wacky, it’s fairly straightforward, but I enjoyed watching it unfold. I don’t think it’s super duper original, but it’s entertaining and well-executed.\n\n[*]Most of your time with the game is spent reading the dialog, I found it to be compelling stuff for the most part. The characters are well varied, and they did a good job of making them have distinct personalities. \n\n[*]Music is used to great effect to really set the scene at certain points throughout the game. [/list]\n\n[h1]Neutral: [/h1]\n[list][*]Other than a couple of puzzles to solve, this is a pretty hands-off experience. Personally, I enjoy a story-heavy/gameplay-light game every once in a while, but some people may not be too keen on the lack of interaction. [/list]\n\n[h1]Negatives[/h1]\n[list][*]While I did enjoy the plot, I did kind of feel like it lacked some depth. I would have liked to know a little bit more about the relationships between some of the characters and the game did kind of feel like it was over just as it had begun. \n\n[*]There’s no scene/chapter select once you finish the game, so if you miss out on any of the achievements you have to replay the whole thing to get them. [/list]\n\n[h1]Verdict: [/h1]\n\nClam Man is a hilarious little game with compelling dialog and a wacky plot. For a game set underwater, it does lack a little depth, but this is an easy recommendation for comedic adventure game fans.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please consider following my curator page: [url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33633486/]Kemo's Corner.[/url]","timestamp_created":1568149428,"timestamp_updated":1568149833,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":24,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.740926027297973633","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"54481802","author":{"steamid":"76561198123274967","num_games_owned":392,"num_reviews":42,"playtime_forever":172,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":172,"last_played":1565038256},"language":"english","review":"I really wanted to like Clam Man, and I did, but I had the thought \"the sequel is going to be amazing\" more often than \"THIS game is amazing.\"\n\nYou play as a clam/human hybrid who is trying to get to the bottom of a conspiracy involving a mayonnaise company. The story is wacky but not overly so, and the dialogue is very, very funny. The game has some 4th wall breaking humour, as well as sharp comedy in the interactions between characters. Your character isn't a bumbling fool, nor a genius, but manages a nice middle-ground which few adventure games achieve. The game is genuinely hilarious. I can't think of a single joke which failed to land, and it doesn't rely on cheap gags, which is a rarity in comedy games.\n\nThe graphics are pleasant and the soundtrack works well, but they are both clearly a low-budget affair. The animation of the mobsters in particular reminded me of old flash games, and the not infrequent graphical bugs compound this. There is no voice acting, instead getting a quiet bobbling sound (which doesn't vary for different characters?) but some well-placed sound effects do work well.\n\nThe biggest problem I have with clam man is the lack of gameplay. You have an inventory, which only becomes important about half way through the game, and which only holds about 6 items total through the entirety of the game. There's only really 2 proper puzzles to speak of. One is a simple inventory puzzle and the other is a logic-style minipuzzle. This second puzzle is weirdly very difficult, so feels a bit out of place. In addition to the puzzles, the dialogue trees generally speaking need to be exhausted, as sometimes options will result in the game progressing in a way you couldn't have predicted. Worse still, they need to be exhausted in order - a couple of times I chose options out of order and the resulting conversation made less sense.\n\nAs a result, this game can feel too often like a slideshow.

King of a fantasy kingdom? low hanging fruit. Pirates? Of course.  Unlucky guy who wears leisure suits?  Old hat.  Space Janitor? yep.  Skeleton who frequents jive bars in the underworld? been there done that.\n\nClam man?......\n\nYou obviously have my attention.\n\nIf you are offered a free review copy of a game in which you play as a talking clam man, the only real option you have is to stop whatever it is you are doing and play said game immediately.  This title came with no description from the creator directly. I gathered they thought its title and screenshots would be enough to get me interested to play it- they were very correct.\n\n\nPros\n-------------------------------------------------\n-The game is just hilarious.  Great dialogue/monologues and 4th wall breaking humor. \n-A true P&C style adventure story: funny, absurdist, and unique\n-Graphical style gives a look like it was painted by hand.  \n-Great original soundtrack, funny songs (\"...ROPE!....KNOTS!...\")\n-Made with the Unity engine.  No weird setup issues like AGS can sometimes have.\n-Subtle pop culture references (hitchhikers guide to the galaxy, stranger things, star wars)\n\n\nMeh.\n-------------------------------------------------\n-No voices.  All characters make a noise like the teacher from the snoopy cartoons.\n-Some minor bugs (Some issues with music volume conflicting with the speaking noise/speaking noise not playing at all, couldn't access game menu in front of apartment)\n-A few cases where the music looping had an abrupt replay transition.\n-Dialogue/Monologue intensive game play.  Not as bad as Randal's Monday, but between this and a lack of inventory usage( more on this later) it makes it feel more like a visual novel/dialogue-choices-matter game.\n\n\nCons\n-------------------------------------------------\n-A called this a true P&C story, however it is not true P&C style game play.  What I mean by this namely is a real lack of inventory usage or interactions.  I consider this its big drawback as a P&C aficionado and would love to have seen more inventory interaction puzzles.\n-At $10 asking price for approx. 2 hrs game play it is kind of pricey for a P&C game.\n-No save slots.\n-No ability to pause game or dialogue\n\n\nTo recap I consider this game to have a very high quality story, dialogue, background music/sound effects, and overall game stability.  If your still reading this and are a P&C aficionado like myself, stop and just buy it already!","timestamp_created":1560672158,"timestamp_updated":1560672433,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":32,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.771013617515563965","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":false,"received_for_free":true,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51211290","author":{"steamid":"76561198021078174","num_games_owned":140,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":141,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":141,"last_played":1560431724},"language":"english","review":"a charming little short story with witty dialouge. \n\npros: \nhumor \nstory (allthough short) \nartstyle \n\ncons: \nthe puzzles were so few and easy they might have removed them alltogether. \nhad the puzzles been any fewer I would have mistaken the whole game for a videoclip \nwhere you click to move the story forward. \n\nThoughts: \n-I will happily play a sequal of this if the excellent storywriters and illustrators team up with a puzzle master to make up for one of the core elements of a p&c ....the Puzzles","timestamp_created":1560461988,"timestamp_updated":1560461988,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51209462","author":{"steamid":"76561198045380427","num_games_owned":3745,"num_reviews":339,"playtime_forever":138,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":138,"last_played":1560447613},"language":"english","review":"[code][url=https://store.steampowered.com/curator/33025671-Missi-the-Achievement-Huntress/] Please see my curator page for more games that are worth your time [/url][/code]\n\n[B]Approximate amount of time to 100%:[/B] 1,5 - 2,5h\n[B]Estimated achievement difficulty:[/B] 2/10\n[B]Minimum number of playthroughs needed:[/B] 1 if using a trick from the guide from Hanni, 2 if you don't use that. \n[B]Has it been in a bundle:[/B] No\n[B]Is there a good guide available:[/B] Yes, the one from Hanni on the steam forum\n[B]How many people have completed this game at the time I'm writing this review:[/B] 3 on Astats\n\n[B]Multiplayer achievements:[/B] No\n[B]Missable achievements:[/B] A few, but if you have to replay the game for them it will take around 30 minutes to replay the game when skipping the text. \n[B]Grinding Achievements:[/B] No\n[B]DLC-Only achievements:[/B] No\n[B]Time-gated achievements:[/B] No\n[B]RNG-achievements:[/B] No\n[B]Does difficulty affect achievements:[/B] no difficulty option\n[B]Unobtainable/glitched achievements:[/B] No\n\nThis is a fun point & click adventure with a lot of humor.

A humorous clam man’s adventure, whose name is Clam Man, who literally working on the ocean floor in a  underwater town inhabited by other anthropomorphic seamen, begins with dismal technical support customer service, and ends with almost a noir struggle for justice and peace in the world. The game has its own obvious style, it is very satirical, jokes on topical issues, while remaining very cozy and hospitable. She has an extremely short duration (about 2-3 hours), but every minute of this time is full of jokes, gags, comic situations, play on words, sea jokes and a lot of incredible situations. And after all, the plot, even with such a saturation of humor, remains quite an interesting detective story that keeps attention to the end. In this game, it reminds me of the reckless series of Sam and Max games, for some reason it seems to me that the creators also love these games very much, some invisible vibrations of the wonderful adventures of the dog and the rabbit are felt here. It is easy to see the creative influence of SpongeBob SquarePants, which is also not at all something bad (and I’m also a big fan of this cartoon, yes). \n\nThere are not so many puzzles in the game, I generally remembered about the availability of inventory in the middle of the game and the items will need to be used only a couple of times, but her mood and endlessly cheerful humor overlap everything. The last time I laughed so hard that a crack appeared in my face, at the Paradigm game, probably. Humor is very lively, not vulgar, various, comes to the point to all situations, and vivid and memorable characters make it even more delicious. The song, which sounds after the working day of the main character, literally caused me to cry, it's priceless. An underwater adventure that DIDN'T DROWN in the ocean of humor, but flashed by a bright and beautiful fish, I really hope that this is the beginning of a large series of games (not for nothing that I remembered Sam and Max), a charming gaming experience.","timestamp_created":1559957997,"timestamp_updated":1559958223,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":18,"votes_funny":2,"weighted_vote_score":"0.674516975879669189","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":false,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"51040677","author":{"steamid":"76561198372255834","num_games_owned":81,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":154,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":154,"last_played":1559583186},"language":"english","review":"Wish there were more games like this out there.

While it's mostly jokes, there's a tangible fun story to go through as simple as it may be. It knows what it is and plays around with a lot of referential and 4th wall humor to help guide it, but doesn't rely on it for laughs. There's quite a few times I had to catch my breath before continuing after a joke.\n\nThe puzzles are usually only a few steps removed from simple intuitive solutions, so they're not brainbusters by any means but there's still a few satisfying solutions to be found. They are mostly used as a vehicle for another joke, whether it's meta or not, which usually pay off in a fun way.\n\nOverall it feels like a chapter from any one of the famous point and clicks was taken out and morphed into it's own game - you're not going to get a sweeping epic story but you'll have a fun time in a weird location with some wacky characters and probably get at least a few laughs out of your time.

I laughed several times through the adventure, and as someone with the personality of a robot, that's kind of hard to achieve. Since the game was obviously made from a small team, they needed to put their effort where it mattered, which in this case is the writing, and I think they made the right call. Since 90% of this game is basically setup of the scene followed by a string of jokes, it's important that at least some of them land, and I'd say that most do (it's really hard to critique comedy, so maybe I'm super wrong). in any case, none of the jokes outstay their welcome. There might have been a bit too many references for me, since those don't tend to age that well, but at least they were references to things I enjoy.\n\nI'm not sure if this is just me missing the point entirely, or if there's merit to my criticism, but I kind of wish there would have been more to the actual writing of the plot and characters. I suspect that when you write something that has to be simplified in order to make the jokes more pronounced, character depth might need to suffer for it, but I always hope that isn't the case. That said, Clam Man and His Amazing Friends are likable, and he at least has a clear goal, and sometimes that's all you need to set the stage.\n\nThere's not a lot of puzzles, and the ones that are there don't really require any logic that makes you feel clever or inventive. It almost feels like they exist only because that's the genre. It is nice, however, that they occasionally use the genre to play with your expectations.\n\nIn the end I had a lot of fun. While the characters weren't exactly deep, all of them were instantly charming and consistently made me smile. It's also nice to play a nice little indie game made by actual human beings who want you to have a good time. I recommend it! If you miss the dense, sometimes wacky humor of Monkey Island or Sam & Max, or don't even know what that's like, you should give this a try!\n","timestamp_created":1558638951,"timestamp_updated":1558638951,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":12,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.576942503452301025","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50787024","author":{"steamid":"76561198011829247","num_games_owned":1500,"num_reviews":127,"playtime_forever":113,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":113,"last_played":1558631127},"language":"english","review":"👍","timestamp_created":1558631208,"timestamp_updated":1558631208,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":6,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.49763372540473938","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":false,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}],"cursor":"AoJwxJrq8uoCcK3ewQE="}
