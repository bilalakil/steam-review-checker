In this game series, you must protect your gems from would-be thieves and do-gooders coming to plunder your loot. There is... some semblance of a story. You get a short blurb every time before you start a mission, but that's about it and you can completely ignore it. In all likelihood players such as myself forgot it exists.\n\nGameplay is your usual tower defense. Towers are placed in predefined areas of terrain, and they will automatically attack any targets in range. I like that each tower type is pretty unique. Dens fire quickly, Temples attack multiple targets, and Crypts build up charges for bursts. Further upgrading the towers changes their attack patterns even more. In addition to your main tower types, sometimes you may find special towers on various maps. Even enemies may have structures of their own that you can destroy by injecting the appropriate resource. Once combat is initiated, it cannot be stopped. You can however speed up and slow the game at any time. Calling in waves early will provide bonus cash.\n\nEvery once in a while the game will throw a boss battle at you. These bosses often require unusual gimmicks to defeat such as clicking on spawns before they hatch. I rather like these battles, as they make the game much more interactive, and there's not too many of them to make me irritated.\n\nAs you complete maps, you earn experience and levels which gives points to allocate and improve various aspects of the game to make combat easier. Weirdly, experience scales very steeply as you run later maps. The fastest way to grind bar none is to run the farthest map down the line that you can complete because the experience rate is just that good. One irritating aspect of the game is that in order to obtain three stars, your gems must not be touched, period. It's completely optional, but it will always gnaw at me to see that two star blemish on some maps.\n\nThe art is generally good, going for a similar cartoony vibe as Kingdom Rush. However I preferred the look of the first game. I don't know if it's just me, but I experience a noticeable amount of load times when loading up a stage. The rest of the game runs fine though. The music is... passable. It gets repetitive rather quickly, so I recommend putting your own music on. I did not encounter any crashes or bugs, so that's always good.\n\nI rate Cursed Treasure 2 a B-. I remember liking the first game a lot, and I'm not sure what changed in this one to make it less fun. This is a good game, it just feels... a little emptier? The boss battles are good though, and the game is a fine way to pass some time.","timestamp_created":1614113258,"timestamp_updated":1614113258,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.523809552192687988","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":false,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86971519","author":{"steamid":"76561197986208676","num_games_owned":131,"num_reviews":1,"playtime_forever":1317,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1106,"last_played":1619274388},"language":"german","review":"\nBestes TD game was ich jeh gespielt habe, knifflige Missionen, toller Skilltree, gerne Mehr davon!","timestamp_created":1613671449,"timestamp_updated":1613671449,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"86761747","author":{"steamid":"76561198272908267","num_games_owned":303,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":1677,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":523,"last_played":1613611888},"language":"english","review":"I've always liked the concept of tower defence games, but none really hooked me in like this one.

To 3-star every level without replaying would be very hard IMO - but the key thing is it doesn't feel like a grind at all. \n2. The night level is ingenious. This is where you get the same map, but you can only place towers where your other towers / fortifications have extended and lighted up the dark areas. This gives you an entirely new perspective on how you might do the map. \n3. The RPG elements where you can gain new abilities / get better is very well done. \n4. Nice mix of maps. \n5. The special enemies that can wreak havoc really make you think a bit different on your layouts. \n\nYou being the bad guys and the good guys attacking is kind of funny.

Imagine someone wanting to give money for a game that has been played and finished for free many times before just for gratitude (and achievements haha).\n\nCursed Trasure 2 is a tower defense game with very nice jokes and humor and with the most balanced gameplay I have ever seen in a game. There are three types of towers and you have to use them to kill so called 'heroes' that want to take your gems. They are different, with different roles, different skills linked to them and you can develop strategies that you rely on one or two or all of them combined, it's really amazing how instead of one \"build that cheeses everything and breaks the game\" you have a lot of special ways to act on each level and multiple ways of building. I used to love necro and hate orcs and then changed my gamestyle to favor demons instead of necros, but demons pair so well with orcs that I started to like them as well. It's an amazing game, pay attention to the details, to the flavour text, it's really good and full of easter eggs.","timestamp_created":1606533515,"timestamp_updated":1621708257,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.557793974876403809","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"80644535","author":{"steamid":"76561198248560676","num_games_owned":697,"num_reviews":45,"playtime_forever":597,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":251,"last_played":1606701405},"language":"polish","review":"Zagrywałem się dawno temu w część pierwszą jeszcze na kongregate.com.

How do you make the game challenging enough that it doesn't feel like a waste when there are readily-available free alternatives littering the internet, but also not make it so frustrating that no one cares to actually finish it?\n\nFor the most part, it seems like devs don't really consider the last part of that a problem because by then they've already gotten paid, and that's annoying.\n\nHowever, this game almost perfectly balances the two, not really falling into the trap of 'well you're at the mercy of the RNG now' until the last few missions, and even then you can still replay earlier missions for skulls to buy the power-ups that would help you take care of them anyway.\n\nIt's a fun tower defense game with you playing as an evil overlord who for some reason needs to take your weak point with you to the front lines of every area you're trying to conquer.  That doesn't seem ideal but whatever, don't ask questions.  I'm sure the heroes are happy they don't have to venture into Mordor to defeat the enemy since you're helpfully bringing your precious gems right to their front door for every single level.\n\nBut again, the logic isn't really the point, so moving on.\n\nYou have the typical tower defense thing where you have these towers, and you'll level them up in battles, and gain XP that give you additional benefits, and this is one of the ones were you can actually max out your levels before the end so you really are at full strength when you finish the game - kudos to them for that, too!\n\nI'm never in love with 'you're the villain' games, if I was I'd have definitely bought Infectionator by now, but it's easy enough to overlook that because a lot of these enemies are so annoyingly tenacious it's easy to forget that they're ostensibly the good guys here.\n\nAs I sort of mentioned previously, there are also skulls, which function as a kind of in-game currency for buying special magical bonuses - additional gold, which is always useful; refilling your magic, which is really only useful once you've really increased your magic pool, otherwise it's a bit of a waste; returning all your gems to the start, which I don't think sets them to 'untouched' so it can't turn a 2-star run into a 3-star run (and is thus kinda useless), but that's just theory, I've never actually used it.  All sorts of things, and you'll definitely need them by the end unless 'at the mercy of the RNG' is your idea of a good time.  And if it is, what the hell is wrong with you?  Who hurt you?\n\nAnyway, it's a good time.  I mean, check out my playtime, then the price, and then consider the potential cost per hour of entertainment you're getting here.  Is it the perfect game?  No.  But is it fun, a great way to spend an otherwise boring few hours at a time, and a good value?  Absolutely!\n\nEdit:  OK, using the 'return gems' thing only returns ones that are still on-screen, but DOES restore them to 'untouched' status.  So it can turn a 2-star run (gems have been touched, but not TAKEN) into a 3-star run (gems untouched), but can't salvage a 1-star run.","timestamp_created":1592166257,"timestamp_updated":1592172356,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70689012","author":{"steamid":"76561198032457930","num_games_owned":1481,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":1693,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1508,"last_played":1609276141},"language":"english","review":"\nGeneral: \n\nRating: E? T?  \nPrice: $4.99\nGenre: Tower Defense\nTime played: 25 hours (steam) 100? (Kongregate) \n\nOne of my favorite Tower Defense games back from the Kongregate days.  Very addictive and tons of fun.  Kill everything trying to take your gems!\n\n\nGameplay - 10\n\nA solid tower defense game, you only have 3 different towers, orc, demon, undead,  that can be built only on specific pieces of ground for each tower. As you progress in the game you will unlock higher levels of the towers. Your towers gain XP with each kill, and later on their own, once you have enough XP you can pay to level up to the next level adding damage/speed/range. Also at 2nd and 4th level you can choose a path for each tower.  This can change how the tower shoots and change them from a damage dealer to a debuffer or something else.   Always make sure you check the tower info. \n\nEach of the towers have their own role in the game and depending on how you upgrade them changes their attacks. Leveling your towers can get expensive but very worth it if you are going for the “Brilliant” status on each map.\n. There’s a lot of levels and each one has a day and night mode to beat.  Night mode makes most of the map covered by shadows/night.  You can only build close to your cave at first then can start branching out, making things a little more difficult. \n\nYou also have 2 spells you can unlock and upgrade. Meteor and Fear, one calls a giant meteor to hit the point you selected killing/decimating everything that was there.  The other makes the ‘bad’ guys run the opposite way. I’ll leave it to you to figure which is which. \n\nStory -  6?\n\nYou’re the bad guy who wants to take over the world.  You have power in your gems and all the people you’re trying to kill/enslave are sending their best to steal the gems. \n\nNot as classic as boy meets girl, falls in love, gets shot into the sun, but still a solid story?\n\nGraphics -  8\n\nThe game came out quite some time ago, it’s only been on steam for 3 years but it has decent graphics. \n\nControls - 10(mouse/keyboard)\n\nNothing too difficult.  You can press 1 or 2 for the spells. Rest of it is mostly just clicking on the screen for what you want. There were some other keyboard shortcuts but I can’t take all the fun out of the game can I?\n\n\n\nRepeatability - 5\n\nThe big thing in this game is leveling up and upgrading your skills.  To do this you will have to play the levels over and over.  Luckily you can die and still get some XP.  The later levels give you more XP than the first levels.  So you can say you have a lot of replay value, but once you have 3 stars on all levels, day and night, I don’t see coming back to play the game.    \n\n\nMusic - 8\n\nThe sounds/music were fitting and I enjoyed them.  There are some cues in the game that you can hear, some of the heroes have skills that are activated with a sound so you know about them. So the sounds/music can be helpful but I also managed to play it on steam with  no sound with no problem.  Your choice. \n\n\n\nMultiplayer - N/A\n\n\nInitial Thoughts: \n\nOooo I remember this game. Welp I have to buy it immediately if not sooner. \n\nSoma Says: \n\n This is one of those games that I remember from Kongregate, as soon as I saw it on Steam I quickly bought it.  Lots of time spent on Kongregate with gems like this I can’t recommend it enough. \n\nIt’s an all around solid tower defense game.  I have run into a few bugs and the game has crashed once or twice but nothing serious and I was able to come back later and play without any problems. I’ve also noticed there’s some balance issues on the last few levels, against the dwarves.  The other thing I should mention is the skulls.  You collect them by killing people and eventually you’ll end up with a lot.  The skulls can be used to buy 1 time perks that can make any level easier.  Like 100 skulls for full mana, I would wait till you have this fully upgraded to make the most of it, or 150 skulls for 1000 gold.   That would help you build numerous towers or upgrade them.  Either way I did use it on some levels to help me out, just to get the 3 stars  Don’t judge me.

HOWEVER in this one it really serves the game very well and doesn't diminish at all this feeling of really 'blasting' your enemies!\nThe humor in this game is both funny and surprising. My favorite ones are clearly [spoiler] those little knights first losing their armors then running in their underwear before you can finish them [/spoiler] ! ...I catch myself giggling like a child each time!\nThe so many units you end-up facing and the variety of their unique strengths and behaviors keeps this game entertaining and addictive, even at the very late stages.\nYou technically only have 3 types of towers. But the so many upgrade options and other gadgets added alongside most paths makes it feel like you have a huge variety of strategic options to choose from. And the amount of enemy waves increasing as you progress through the levels really give you this opportunity to FULLY upgrade your towers, which is something missed by so many TD games.\nAll this combined with 2 play mode options for every levels, i.e. \"day time \" and \"night time\" (fog of war), give this game quite a fair bit of replayability as well.\nOh! And also contrary to too many other games: This one IS hard...but not impossible! \nIn other words: This solid game, runny smoothly and keeping you entertained, is an absolute 'thumbs-up' and a 'must own' for any fans of the Tower Defense genre!!\n","timestamp_created":1591485278,"timestamp_updated":1591485278,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":5,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.596739530563354492","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"70377155","author":{"steamid":"76561198080327129","num_games_owned":269,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2385,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":2385,"last_played":1577008671},"language":"english","review":"Awesome classic style tower defense with many unique enemies and mechanics.

Even at a high level, Mechanics and Ninjas get through waves way too easily. They start their stealth from being hit almost immediately at start of a wave when you can't even set a tower to the very start and then stay in stealth and keep moving at high speed towards the gem base, only to appear almost right next to your gem base. Then in next waves you get engineers using smoke screens at regular intervals - the engineers have really high health, move some distance between each other and the smoke screens last 6 seconds and have high radius. As a result, almost the whole road is covered in smoke screen and 90% of your firepower is rendered useless.\n\nYou are quickly out of mana from fearing ninjas away from the gem base and getting around the DPS efficiency problem means using \"mobile-currency\". This just makes the gameplay seem unbalanced.---\n\n\nEdit: After trying to get brilliants for the last levels without much of mobile-currency, I feel like not recommending the Steam version of this game. The last levels at brilliant rating can require too much mobile currency depending on your style of play and want to experiment. One mistake and you have to farm for an hour or more to have another chance at a brilliant.\n\nHaving to use mobile currency to get through obviously overpowered (read: high health) enemies makes the gameplay unbalanced. Yet these problems are mostly shown in last 25% of the levels. Rest of the game is still enjoyable.\n\n7.5/10","timestamp_created":1589205458,"timestamp_updated":1589464201,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68856976","author":{"steamid":"76561198066976213","num_games_owned":107,"num_reviews":18,"playtime_forever":637,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":262,"last_played":1592638315},"language":"tchinese","review":"很好玩, 以前Flash的一代也是很耐玩, 跟Kingdom rush比起來, 這款比較農一點, 要稍微刷一下等級把技能點高否則拓荒都是一星通關居多","timestamp_created":1589043630,"timestamp_updated":1589043630,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"68835951","author":{"steamid":"76561198069815235","num_games_owned":1912,"num_reviews":76,"playtime_forever":1386,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1386,"last_played":1559412168},"language":"english","review":"I cant decide whether or not to recommend this honestly.\n\nOn one hand its one of the best Classic Tower Defense games ever, almost rivaling Dungeon Warfare and Kingdom Rush but then....theres the end game...\n\nThe entire game is well balanced until the end, where the final section is plagued by one of the worst things ever, that being balanced around forcing people to buy microtransactions.

Its predecessor was one of my favored TD games on Kongregate back in 2010 before I could afford a gaming PC, and that's why I paid full price for this one without question. The concept is simple: on each map, you have five gems to protect, and you have three factions of \"evil\" towers to help you defend them. Each map has three varied ground types, which determines which tower can go there (red=demon, purple/gray=undead, green=orcs). This allows for some interesting strategies since each faction has multiple upgrade trees and you can't place them around the map willy-nilly. \n\nNot only do you have access to beautiful, colorful maps in many locales with plenty of tower options with which to conquer them, but you also upgrade overall as a player. Playing each map through to victory or loss grants you XP, affected by many multipliers. These level you up and grant you access to three further upgrade trees that will affect your game henceforth. You have a select few spells that you can make cheaper and more destructive, each faction's tower can be upgraded to grant new abilities and status effects, etc. Mastering every three levels grants you access to night mode, which is a wonderful unique mode in which you play the same level without access to the entire map right away. Instead, you must build by the path of light, which comes from seized buildings, other towers, etc. Night mode is not required to play in order to beat the campaign, but I played them anyway; not only are they fun, they also grant you lots of XP.\n\nFor the most part, Cursed Treasure 2 isn't a grindy game. Only a few times did I replay levels for XP so I could upgrade and retry a challenging level; there are so many levels and modes that grant you XP here that you always have options, and levels continue dropping XP even if you've mastered them before. It's worth noting that the easier the level, the less XP. Mastering early levels grants you 5000 XP; by the final levels, each one grants around 100K or more. \n\nI love Cursed Treasure, so it's no surprise the sequel had me obsessing over mastering levels, upgrading, and trying for achievements. However, there is one really glaring flaw that had the game leaving a sour taste in my mouth: the final three levels. Unbeknownst to me before buying the game, Cursed Treasure 2 is not only available on mobile, but it also has microtransactions in that version. You see, there's a currency in the game called [i]skulls[/i]. Enemies rarely drop it (you can expect to make 2-4K in skulls throughout an entire natural playthrough). Skulls aren't mandatory to beat the game...[i]in theory.[/i] Opening the skull menu mid-level allows you to spend the currency for one-time perks. Spend 100 to refill your mana completely, for one example, or 150 to get 1000 gold. Obviously, this is helpful for levels you're having trouble passing. Personally, I didn't even pay attention to skulls or use them until the final six levels (pirate and dwarf levels). Here's where it gets interesting.\n\nThe game progresses normally and at a difficulty curve that makes sense for 21 levels out of 24. By level 18 or 19, I was maxed out. Rank 51, no more upgrades to purchase. Sure, the pirate levels were challenging and had me replaying a few times to master them, but that's to be expected for end-of-game levels. Then you get to level 22, and the game hits a wall. Enemies don't drop as much gold. Seizing buildings costs more resources, and the benefits they give to your foes are better and more numerous. New foes are introduced that have ridiculous abilities (dwarf with 400 HP who only takes one damage from every hit regardless of how powerful your towers are and also has a shield you have to get through first). I'd gone from understandably challenging and fair levels to losing three out of five gems in the [i]first wave[/i], and I was fully upgraded [i]and using skull abilities[/i]. The PC version of Cursed Treasure 2 has no microtransactions, but like I said, the skulls are very limited. Put two and two together and you begin to realize that even after purchasing the full game, you're still suffering the consequences of a game developed to support microtransactions: balancing issues, poor design, and currency grinding.\n\nI love being challenged, but I refuse to partake in microtransactions or the game design choices developers make to support the system. It's [i]such a shame[/i] Cursed Treasure 2 ends on such a poor note; if it weren't for this utter nonsense, it would have gotten my highest regards for a tower defense game. The first 21 levels are [i]this[/i] close to tower defense perfection, and I'd recommend the game on that alone. Unfortunately, learning the backstory of the final three levels has diluted my trust in this developer. If more games in the Cursed Treasure franchise come out, I'll be interested, but you'd better believe I'll vet them more thoroughly before handing over my money.","timestamp_created":1585539337,"timestamp_updated":1585539364,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":42,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.822173893451690674","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"66052865","author":{"steamid":"76561198163127234","num_games_owned":39,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":698,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":432,"last_played":1599272940},"language":"english","review":"Cursed Treasure 2 is a seemingly simple game where you assume the role of evil Overlord, the bane of mankind. But the job of an Overlord is never easy. Everyone from lazy peasants, to holy Bishops, to even the King and Queen of this fair land want your gems of apparently great value, so they'll throw themselves to their deaths for even a slight glimpse of the gems' unholy splendor. What do you do, with your equally large hordes of Orcs, Demons, and Undead? You take the high ground, build some towers, and pelt them with arrows, spew streams of fire, and orbs of spiritual energy, and if they get too close despite your waves of death, you can hurl fireballs, terrify them, or use the secret dark arts of the Skulls.  This version of the game is different from the free flash version in several ways. You get three new levels, four new spells using a new, permanent currency drop, Skulls, that help to give you the upper hand in tough battles, new functionalities for certain buildings that add a little more depth to how you play, a fullscreen mode and hi-res graphics, and a slightly harder game due to some enemies having some new abilities not in the flash game.

None the less, here's what I think:\n\n[b]-The gameplay is great:[/b] It's very simple, but has quite a bit of depth to it that makes it very replayable: The goal of the game is to use and upgrade the Orc, Undead and Demon towers to kill the invaders and not let them get all your gems.Granted, to lose all your gems and fail you'll need to let the invaders steal them on purpose, but there is a scoring system that rewards you the better you take care of these precious jewels. You get one star (Good) for saving 1-4 gems, two for saving all your gems, but with one or more getting stolen at one point (Great), and three for having all 5 perfectly intact (Brilliant). The game's levels are contained within various areas, which have their own enemies, bosses, and various other gimmicks. Completing an area will unlock Night Mode for all of its levels. Night Mode spikes the difficulty by forcing you to place towers near areas that are lit, such as the gem caves, your towers's ranges, etc. You once again get ranked with Good, Great, or Brilliant star ratings. Overall pretty solid.\n\n[b]-The visuals are very good, mostly:[/b] This game is looks quite different and a LOT more cartoony than the first game, which had a serious and a more gritty-looking tone. The aesthetics are comical and look very nice, but it's bogged down a little bit by the 30FPS lock, and a few textures that look a bit out-of-tone/place (they're mostly seen in the last levels, after Wasteland)\n\n[b]There's next to no story, buuutt...[/b] There's a bit of neat lore: Some bad guy hid his magical/cursed gems inside some caves, and after many years, some kings, queens, priests, mages, thieves etc. want them for some reason or another, so you have to stop them by using the powers of the Orcs, the Undead, and the Demons to kill them and prevent them from capturing them.

It has not disappointed. \nThe core is a basic tower defense game, with a great personality and a fun sense of humor. It has an interesting twist where instead of the units crossing the map and leaving, they are striving to grab one of your five gems, then return out the way they came. It does limit where you can build towers, and what types can go where, which might frustrate people, though they do have certain spots where can put any kind of tower. It doesn't bother me, and I feel allows for more interesting level design.\nControls are smooth and intuitive, (though the double click to do certain things took a little while for me to get used it.) The animation is smooth and the graphics enjoyable, the music is pleasant and avoids getting annoying, while the sound effects really add to the experience.\nThere is also a nice skill progression tree that allows you to get better, even when you fail, which stops the game from ever having that brick-wall level that stops you in your tracks.\nThe one downside here is that it ends well before you reach the finish line. I really don't know why more games don't offer one-shot abilities as well as upgrades, so that you always get a reward for doing better.\nThe tower variety is limited, three basic tower, that each branch into the types at third level, then two more at fifth, however there are only three of each max tower, as whichever path you choose you can opt for a central tower type. \nI do, however, like the fact that each tower requires experience points before you can upgrade them. I find this adds a nice sense of depth to the game.\n(HINT: One of the tech trees eventually gives your towers the ability to gain a few experience points every second, it makes a huge difference.)\nThe strategic decisions between which types of upgrades to use seem relevant to game play, though there does not seem to be a specific way you must do things to win, which is nice.\nThe only other really strategic decision is the spells, of which there are only two, fear and fireball. \nThey are the core of a secondary economy, (gold being primary, and required to build and upgrade towers.) mana. \nMana has several uses though, and often, early in the game, the decision between saving it up for spells and using it to clear areas to build towers, or attack one of the variety of build types (or pirate ships) is crucial. (NOTE: The buildings add real flavor. You can open up a gold mine, or a mana well, or destroy secondary enemy entrances, and more.) Especially if trying for a perfect level, having enough mama for that last second save is important.\nNote, there is no pathing, this is not a big deal for me, but I know some tower defense afficiandos will want to know this in advance. For me pathing can be fun, but isn't required for me to have fun, and I find this game fun.\nAn odd tidbit, but one I really like, is that each of the various enemy units retain the same skills, abilities and hit points throughout the game. Not a fan of games where the core change in difficulty is using the same few units with more and more (and more) hit points. I like the look to mean something, and in this game it does.","timestamp_created":1559628999,"timestamp_updated":1559629017,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":1,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.52173912525177002","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50707385","author":{"steamid":"76561198085295478","num_games_owned":213,"num_reviews":20,"playtime_forever":2947,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1429,"last_played":1566056595},"language":"latam","review":"Super entretenido y anda perfecto en Linux.","timestamp_created":1558206276,"timestamp_updated":1558206276,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50699965","author":{"steamid":"76561198439953480","num_games_owned":411,"num_reviews":10,"playtime_forever":3754,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":401,"last_played":1614818863},"language":"schinese","review":"比kingdom rush难多了！！！","timestamp_created":1558176466,"timestamp_updated":1558176466,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":11,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.65445023775100708","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50660630","author":{"steamid":"76561197984040110","num_games_owned":1456,"num_reviews":71,"playtime_forever":1176,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1104,"last_played":1559362825},"language":"english","review":"An excellent TD game to scratch the itch for a very reasonable price. \n\nI never played the first one and would certainly throw some money at it should it ever come to steam.","timestamp_created":1557945693,"timestamp_updated":1557945693,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false}, {"recommendationid":"50656056","author":{"steamid":"76561198042445300","num_games_owned":420,"num_reviews":19,"playtime_forever":4631,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1729,"last_played":1558584923},"language":"english","review":"This game is very fun.

Bosses showcase some nice creativity as well.\n\nNow I will write a bunch of things I kinda disliked, but take it with a grain of salt. The game is cheap and worth the money. While free on other sides, supporting it in hopes of more competent TD-games seems like a fair investment. Also with 24 levels split into 8 regions, each with unique enemies, some interesting stage assets (like enemy spawners or mana-pools) to interact with and a challenging boss - the game is absolutely worth the money.\n\nBiggest downside for the game is the lack of freedom in terms of tactics. You can't choose \"where\" to place towers, as it is dictated by the terrain. You can't choose what towers to upgrade, as it is dictated by XP the towers gain for shooting enemies and you often won't have trouble with gold to upgrade towers. You can't influence the walkpath of enemies either.\nThis makes it quite handholdy, as you motly just choose when to place towers and which one of the 2 upgrade paths you take. Also you have skills to upgrade which offer a lot of different boni - but you will end up with all of them at the end of the game.\nTo top it all off, the game basically has \"legal cheats\" with a skull-currency you accumulate over levels and can be used to get a ton of gold, mana or severly damage all enemies on the field.\n\nSo if you ever feel stuck, farming XP and/or skulls will do the trick. While slight variations in tactics are possible and can change the outcome, it lacks the typical TD-challenge - consisting of building mazes, creating tower-combinations or just generally adapting to the enemy.","timestamp_created":1557583982,"timestamp_updated":1557583982,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50573715","author":{"steamid":"76561198219552337","num_games_owned":360,"num_reviews":316,"playtime_forever":673,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":307,"last_played":1557581618},"language":"tchinese","review":"好玩的塔防游戲，但...\n敵方多路進攻，卻不能蓋迷宮\n地形限制了塔的類型\n塔的升級除了錢還得靠打怪的經驗值\n各種限制造成每張圖的攻略方式固定\n我個人不愛...但還是打完了...\n------------------------------------------\n火塔最好用\n最后一関太難，不用骷髏過不了\n有個敵人會讓塔失去作用一段時間，根本整人的設計","timestamp_created":1557499316,"timestamp_updated":1557581944,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":0,"comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"50562417","author":{"steamid":"76561198100298071","num_games_owned":185,"num_reviews":28,"playtime_forever":1224,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":510,"last_played":1561396877},"language":"english","review":"if u like tower defense, this is the best i've ever playeed. idk wtf are u doing.

Kingdom Rush! Kingdom Rush! :-)\n\nDa sag noch mal einer \"warum soll man im Steam Sale für olle Silberkarten die Listen durchklicken?\".\nGing mir auch so, bis ich per Zufall auf dieses Juwel gestoßen bin!\n\nEs sieht nicht nur so aus wie Kingdom Rush, es spielt sich auch nicht nur so, es ist vom gleichen Publisher.\n\nDas Spiel setzt auf den gleichen Comicstyle und den gleichen Spielcharme, ändert jedoch ein paar Kleinigkeiten ab, meiner Meinung nach sogar zum Positiven:\nEs gibt endlich zahlreiche Upgrademöglichkeiten für die 3 Turmsorten.\nJa, nur 3. Die Kaserne wurde wegrationalisiert, ebenso die Helden.\nDadurch wird das Spiel auch besser spielbar und man kann sich auf die Türme konzentrieren.\nDafür wurde ein kleines Ressourcenmanagement eingeführt.\nDas bedeutet, auf jeder Karte gibt es evtl. Gebäude, womit man Gold oder Mana pro Sekunde generieren kann, wenn man vorher investiert.\nAndersherum gibt es aber auch Gebäude der \"Guten\" Fraktion (wir spielen die \"Bösen\").\nDort werden dann jede Runde zusätzliche Einheiten produziert, bis man auch dort Ressourcen reinsteckt.\nAuch gibt es ein paar Gebäude wie z.B. einen Leuchtturm, der zuerst die Gegner schneller macht, nach genügend \"Input\" aber unserer Seite behilflich ist und die heranstürmenden Gegner verbrennt.\n\nNach dem Ableben lassen die Gegner auch gerne mal Gold, Mana, Zauber, oder auch Totenköpfe fallen.\nDiese Totenköpfe kann man in einem Shop z.B. für zusätzliches Geld oder Mana etc. ausgeben.\nDadurch ist es also möglich, dass auch Anfänger das Ende des Spiels sehen können, wenn man denn lange genug farmt (wenn man es benötigt).\nWer dringend neue Totenköpfe braucht (man sollte die eigentlich alle bis für Level 20+ aufsparen und nur im Notfall einsetzen!), der sollte Level 21 ganz normal bis zum Boss (Piratenschiff) spielen, alle Türme aufleveln und dann durchlaufen lassen (3x) und erst einmal weggehen.\nSo kann man dann nach einer halben Stunde Dauerballern gut was aufsammeln.\n\nEs gibt 24 Level mit Tag und Nachmodus.\nLetzterer wird erst später freigeschaltet und man muss durch setzen von Türmen weitere Felder sichtbar machen.\nIm Grunde genommen ist das kaum anspruchsvoller.\nDie üblichen 3-Sterne-Bewertungen sorgen dafür, dass man auch unbedingt den 100% Savegame haben will, denn Steam hat dafür Errungenschaften parat.\n\nFür die letzten Level habe ich dann die oben angesprochenen Totenköpfe verbraucht (erst mal so spielen und gewinnen, um zu wissen wie das Level läuft).\nDazu 2x Gold eintauschen und das vorhandene Mana zum Abroden der Felder verwenden, dann 1x Mana dazukaufen.\nNun vorhandene Ressourcenfelder etc. nach Belieben vollknallen und sich den weiteren Spielverlauf erleichtern.\nAlle wichtigen Felder mit Türme zupflastern, dann loslegen und hoffentlich die 3-Sterne holen.\nMan muss dann eigentlich nur noch bei den unsichtbaren Gegnern aufpassen, diese dann ggf. abfackeln oder verschrecken.\n\nAls Tipp noch fürs letzte Level:\nWie schon bei den Zwergenbohrern, sollte man bei den 3 Königen nur den Verschrecken Zauber anwenden,d er ist billig genug und kann bei richtiger Platzierung auch gleich die vernebelten Türme wieder reaktivieren.\nAlso das ist ganz wichtig, sonst verliert man, egal wieviel Gold man sich vorher gegeben hat.\n\nSo, nun aber schnell kaufen und selber spielen, denn es ist im Sale noch im Angebot!!!\n\nViel Spaß damit, mit einem der wirklich besten TD Games ever!","timestamp_created":1546347333,"timestamp_updated":1546347632,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":7,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.57582390308380127","comment_count":2,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"47794056","author":{"steamid":"76561198372778218","num_games_owned":45,"num_reviews":23,"playtime_forever":918,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":752,"last_played":1522364940},"language":"english","review":"First tower defense game I have played and the best one too. :)","timestamp_created":1545703305,"timestamp_updated":1545703305,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.466666668653488159","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"46818657","author":{"steamid":"76561198017152657","num_games_owned":163,"num_reviews":5,"playtime_forever":2474,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1974,"last_played":1591390599},"language":"french","review":"Très sympa!","timestamp_created":1543086405,"timestamp_updated":1543086405,"voted_up":true,"votes_up":0,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.481927722692489624","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"45906370","author":{"steamid":"76561198022926520","num_games_owned":221,"num_reviews":2,"playtime_forever":129,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":110,"last_played":1543693944},"language":"english","review":"I love TD-games and this is the best I have ever played.

But suddenly I liked it much. I passed it all in 1 day.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1387190138\n\nYou play for bad guys. Good guys try to still your gems. You have 3 types of tower: demons, orcs and undead. Each tower has 8 upgrades, so there are 27 towers in total. That's pretty enough. Tower of each type can be place at certain terrain. It's not a cool feature, because it forces you to play as it was designed. But there are a lot of other good things, so it ok.\n\nYou can use gold/man resources to power up special buildings. There are barracks of the enemy where enemies come from, you can completely block it with resources. You can upgrade gold mine using mana or mana pool using gold. There are a lot of other special buildings.\n\nThe main flaw is balance. You start every game with same amount of resources (plus bonus from skills), so basically all missions are kinda the same. There are no difficulty settings and the later stages got pretty easy. Anyway, it's pretty fun to manage your resources, cutting trees down and place new towers.\n\nAlso, there is nice life mechanics from Defense Grid. There are only 5 lives(gems). Enemies need to reach it and bring it with themselves to the exit. If a gem drops, other unit can take it.\nThere are several skills which help to prevent.\n\nI passed the game in 5 hours and I enjoyed.\nThe last 3 levels are much harder, so you will need sculls (extremely powerful spells) to pass them. So don;t waste them till 22 level starts.\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1387190112\n\nPros\n- A lot of new features  for TD genre \n- Nice skill tree mechanic with a lot of useful things\n- 24 missions with 6 different locations. A lot of enemies\n- Nice tower development mechanic with experience. Also, there are 27 different towers.\n- There are 2 resources. They are both needed for a several actions. Nice economic addition to the game.\n\n\nCons\n- Not good graphics. All units looks the same.\n- Later waves of any missions are much easier then first waves\n- Not enough strategy there. You will mostly do same actions every mission\n- To pass final 3 levels you need sculls which you need to save or farm\n- Sounds sometimes get really annoying\n\nhttps://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1387190186\n\n[h1]Resume[/h1]\nA nice arcade TD game with a lot of cool features.

Like most games it has a tech tree you can invest in, but one based on experience you receive beating levels. Fair enough, but you need a fair amount of experience to level up, and it quickly starts to feel like you're perpetually behind the curve. Multiple times it's seemed like no matter how I arrange my towers one enemy just barely manages to touch my gems - it's Defense Grid style where they'll try to make off with them, but infuriatingly all they need to do is grab one and there goes your perfect rating. You have spells to help you out, but having to use them feels like you made a mistake and could have beat the level without them. That's particularly true of the skull spells, which just break the rules in your favor.\n\nNot helping this is a building system where you'll often need to sink money or mana into something to give you resources you need, or to keep the enemies from receiving some advantage themselves. That adds more possibilities and more trial and error. What really annoys me is that once you get in a good loop of upgraded towers in levels, they become really easy since by then you have a ton of surplus magic or random drops of scrolls by enemies which can freeze mobs or damage them. Obviously starting off a level can be the most difficult part, but this is a really big extreme.\n\nIt's not a bad game by any means but I like beating levels perfectly the first try in this genre, and while I'm sure that's possible here it's needlessly frustrating.","timestamp_created":1524796418,"timestamp_updated":1524796418,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":4,"votes_funny":0,"weighted_vote_score":"0.50154191255569458","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"41574077","author":{"steamid":"76561198021087888","num_games_owned":150,"num_reviews":104,"playtime_forever":1422,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":1421,"last_played":1576979791},"language":"english","review":"I played the originals over on Kongregate and I was thrilled when Cursed Treasure 2 appeared on Steam.

Getting to play as the \"villian\" is a neat touch. Some reviews complain of having to grind missions for exp, but I only find that to be partially true. They are correct, you will pretty much never 3 star a mission the first time around. Expect it, accept it, and move on. After doing two to three later missions (and leveling up after each), come back, and it will be much easier. Move on again, then come back a bit later and try the night missions. When progressing that way, I reached max level without having to replay any missions (unless, of course, I messed up, but that's on me, not the game). \n\nIt's also true you can find the game free other places. That's how I first played it. However, again in contrast to other reviews, I have not had any crashing problems or lag with many monsters (and I have a very cheap laptop); it plays far better than online version I've tried.

Developed by Iriy Soft, the game was originally published on Armor Games before recieving this updated rerelease. In fact, if you're at all interested in tower defense games you've probably already played this game before on Armor Games.\n\nApproaching this review, I found myself feeling like there are two big questions to answer.\n\n[h1]Is Cursed Treasure 2 any good?[/h1]\nObviously on some level this is going to depend on your opinion of tower defense games, which seems to be a love-it-or-hate-it kind of genre. If you hate tower defense, this game isn't going to change your opinion.\n\nIf you love tower defense? Well, the game is at least competently made. Abilities and upgrades are well thought out and the game controls pretty well.\n\nCompared to other tower defense games, the level of strategy here is... rather simplistic. Each type of tower can only go on a single type of terrain so there's no real decision making in choosing what to place where. (What should I put on this green tile? Duh, an orc tower, the only thing that CAN go there.) There are multiple upgrade paths; for example, orc towers can become either snipers or explosive ballista dens, but there's still not much to decide there. You want snipers in the front, mortars in the back. You want terror crypts in the back to scare enemies and make them run back through your gauntlet again, and frost crypts in the front to slow them down as they make their way through.\n\nThe game isn't the best tower defense there is, but it isn't terrible. It's competent and fun. In fact...\n\nMy Rating: [3/5] MEDIOCRE\n\nSo, on to question number two...\n\n[h1]Is the rerelease worth the money, or should I just play the free version?[/h1]\nThat's a bit of a hard question. There are some thing that I like about this new version and some things I really don't.\n\nThe graphics have improved, and now each region of the game has its own distinct theme. The starting region, Meadowshire, is fairly generic forest and dirt roads, the Holy Mountain is snowy, Tanglewood is green and swampy, and so on. It's a nice touch.\n\nSome of the gameplay mechanics have changed. There are now special spells that require skulls - a new resource and the only resource that carries over between missions - to cast, and which give strong effects like giving you 1,000 free gold or instantly returning all your gems to the caves.\n\nThere's also three new missions set in \"The Deep\", the land of the dwarves.\n\nOn the other hand, difficulty has also been increased, and I'm not sure if I'd say it's been done in a good way. For one, gold mines  have been removed from most of the missions and you'll be seriously money-starved. (And before you ask, villages and castles and the like no longer give gold income when captured; instead they just spit out coins that you can grab when you first hit them.)\n\nAlso, some enemies have been made more difficult. Wizards now have a very powerful mass heal, and the Dendrologists will summon their little tree friends much faster, to the point of actual swarming.\n\nAnd this leads us to the biggest problem... those three new missions against the dwarves? They're just plain broken, to the point of being borderline impossible. This isn't just me talking, either. The official strategy for how to beat them is to save up your skulls over the course of the entire game and just cheese the @#%$ out of them. It's generally considered you'll need to spend 2,000 or so skulls (to put that in perspective, you might get 50 skulls in one mission and the spells themselves cost arund 100-350 skulls to cast) in order to have a real chance.\n\n[h1]In closing...[/h1]\nThe best I can say is, at least it's not just a completely ridiculous cash grab. I was actually surprised to find that the skull-based super spells weren't actually a cash shop and instead a legit in-game thing.\n\n[b]PROS[/b]\n+ Nicely drawn, cute graphics.\n+ Did at least entertain me for several hours.\n\n[b]CONS[/b]\n- Not a lot of deep, strategic decision making.\n- Can be kind of difficult.\n- The last three missions are laughably unbalanced and not really fun at all.\n\n[b]SHOULD I BUY IT?[/b]\nIn the end, I have to ask myself, would I really want to recommend this game to people? If one of my friends came up to me and said \"hey, man, what new game do you think I should play?\" would I name this one?\n\nNo, not really.\n\nIt's not terrible and if you want to spend five bucks on it, hey, go right ahead. But I'm afraid I just really don't feel like I can honestly recommend it.","timestamp_created":1501647135,"timestamp_updated":1501713384,"voted_up":false,"votes_up":35,"votes_funny":1,"weighted_vote_score":"0.688289284706115723","comment_count":0,"steam_purchase":true,"received_for_free":false,"written_during_early_access":false},{"recommendationid":"33958132","author":{"steamid":"76561197977080684","num_games_owned":3047,"num_reviews":146,"playtime_forever":765,"playtime_last_two_weeks":0,"playtime_at_review":360,"last_played":1505573373},"language":"english","review":"This is a tower defense game.

Also we have a lot of things that can help us on our quest,like the super powers and some special bulidings that can give us items like coins for buying new towers. We can use to destroy some terrain to build new towers too.As the game advances,it gets more challenging with the coming of the bosses,that are very strong and call reinforcements,so,you will need to think on a strategy and upgrade the towers to the max. You play the game like a traditional Tower-Defense Game:Using the mouse to make almost everything here,but the game also features some keyboard shortcuts for you too. The main game has 24 levels,but when you defeat the bosses you unlock the night mode that is the same level,but you can build only where the light reaches.Also you have a lot of skills and achievements to unlock as you progress in the game.\n\nGRAPHICS\nCursed Treasure 2 features beautiful and colorful graphics,that can run almost in any computer.\n\nSOUNDTRACK\nA great soundtrack that makes the game more addictive than it is.\n\nSUMMARY\nCursed Treasures 2 is a game for people that want a challenging and fun tower defense game to play and also for newbies that wants to be introduced on this genre too.The game has a lot of explanations to help you and it's also easy to learn.
